# Cat-and-Dog-Classifier-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
This is a Convolutional Neural Network that classifies cat and dog images using keras and Tensorflow backend.

The cnn.py file consists of the actual Convolutional Neural Network keras code. This model is trained and saved as "My_CNN_Model.h5"
The Tkinter File consists of the Application that enables users to select and classify images. It loads the Saved Model File and makes the predictions on images.

To run the Tkinter App, there is no need to compile or train the model. Simply run the Tkinter code in Spyder or other IDE.


Prerequisites:
- Python 3.5 or higher
- Spyder or other Python IDE
- Keras
- Numpy 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Tkinter
- PIL
- The Saved Model File (My_CNN_Model.h5)

Instructions:

- Make sure all the Prerequisites are installed.
- ### Make sure to set the working directory and have the My_CNN_Model.h5 file inside the directory.
- Run the CNN4_Tkinter_2.py python file using Spyder.
- A new Tkinter window will open.
- Click "Select an Image" and browse for the image to classify and hit "OK"
- Get Classifier Results.

## Here is the Classifier in Action :
